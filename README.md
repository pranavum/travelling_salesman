# travelling_salesman

* Just some ideas I had for approaches to the infamous travelling salesman problem
* Both approaches work to some extent but requires more fine-tuning

## Genetic Programming
  * Individuals represent a list of points representing a path throughout cities
  * Genetic algorithm evolves the optimal individual

## Hilbert Space-filling Curve
  * Tracing through all points using Hilbert curve that fills a given lattice of cities
  * Had this idea when watching 3Blue1Brown
